Welcome to DeLoDevOps, where we turn coffee into code and tears into terraform! ☕💻😭

## What is this madness? 🤪

DeLoDevOps is a personal DevOps utility repo that's part Swiss Army knife, part dumpster fire. It's the digital equivalent of that drawer in your kitchen filled with random stuff you're sure will be useful someday.

## Features 🎉

- **Automate All the Things**: Because manually doing stuff is so 2010.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Or as we like to call it, "Jenga, but with servers".
- **Continuous Integration**: We break things faster than you can say "production environment".
- **Continuous Deployment**: Because why wait to push bugs to production?
- **Monitoring**: For when you want to watch your servers burn in real-time.

## Getting Started 🚦

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `make chaos`
3. Pray to the DevOps gods
4. ???
5. Profit!
